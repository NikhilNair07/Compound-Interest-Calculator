# Compound-Interest-Calculator


## Overview:<br>
The Compound Interest Calculator is a simple C++ program that allows users to calculate the growth of an investment over a specific period with compound interest. This program takes user inputs for the principal amount, interest rate increment, and the number of days, and then it computes and displays the compound interest for each day within the given timeframe.<br>

## Features:<br>
1. User-Friendly Interface: The program prompts the user to input the principal amount, interest rate increment, and the number of days, making it easy to use for anyone.<br>

2. Compound Interest Calculation: The program utilizes the compound interest formula to calculate the investment's growth over the specified period.<br>

3. Detailed Output: The program provides a detailed day-by-day breakdown of the investment's value, allowing users to track its growth.<br>

4. Flexible Input: Users can input various values for the principal amount, interest rate increment, and the number of days, making it suitable for different financial scenarios.<br>

5. Clear Documentation: The source code includes comments that explain the purpose of each variable and section of the code, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the program.<br>

## How to Use:<br>
1. Compile and run the C++ program in your preferred development environment.<br>
2. Follow the prompts to input the principal amount, interest rate increment, and the number of days.<br>
3. The program will then display the compound interest for each day within the specified timeframe.<br>
